Image classification is where a computer can analyse an image and identify the ‘class’ the image falls under. (Or a probability of the image being part of a ‘class’.) A class is essentially a label, for instance, ‘car’, ‘animal’, ‘building’ and so on. 

This project aims to create multiple machine learning mdoels to predict if a photo given to the model is either a cat, or a dog. Three different network models were used to find the most efficient and accurate model for image classification.
