For our goal, we are going to use the Cats and Dogs dataset that is given for the project. This dataset has a total of 25000 images, 12500 of them are cats, and the other 12500 are dogs. \par

These images are all informal pet images like the ones we usually have on our phones, and this is important because it means that our model will be more versatile. Otherwise, it would only be able to understand a pet type if the picture had a certain characteristic or was taken in a specific manner. \par

A sample image from the dataset can be seen at Figure 1.
